# About the project
Mcpm is a CLI package manager for minecraft which currently only supports searching for mods.
This is an early version so features and / or code improvements might be added later.
This project was initially started by me because I wanted to learn the rust programming language. If you find any improvements regarding the code-quality please note them with an issue or a pull request.
# Installing
Clone the project and run the following command: ``cargo build``.

Make sure that you have a recent version of the rust compiler installed!
# Usage
Currently, mcpm only supports searching for mods at [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/).

You can do that with the following command: ``mcpm search <mod_name>``
